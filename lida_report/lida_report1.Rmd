# Open access data for transport research: tools, modelling and simulation (OpenInfra)

Positioning motor modes of travel as primary has been linked to adverse physical, mental, and environmental health (reference 1)(image 1). A shift towards a more sustainable - active - transport, such as walking, wheeling, and cycling might help to tackle health problems (reference 2). However, to encourage the uptake of active modes of travel, it is important to consider the needs of citizens -- the active travel infrastructure must meet their needs.
