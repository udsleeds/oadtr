# Open access data for transport research: tools, modelling and simulation (OpenInfra)

## Project overview

<!---Sticking to one paragraph (3-4 sentences) give the background of the project including project aims. Is there anything new or unique about this research? --->

Positioning motor modes of travel as primary has been linked to adverse physical, mental, and environmental health (reference 1)(image 1). A shift towards a more sustainable - active - transport, such as walking, wheeling, and cycling might help to tackle health problems (reference 2). However, to encourage the uptake of active modes of travel, it is important that the infrastructure meets the needs of citizens. For this, citizen participation in the planning process is essential. A potential way to foster engagement is to encourage them to generate data of their local communities which, consequently, could be used make data-informed decisions. In this case, open crowd-sourced data might become invaluable. Given this, the project aims to explore how open crowd-sourced data, specifically OpenStreetMap(OSM) data, can be used to *understand*, *prioritise*, and *design* active travel infrastructure. 

## Data and methods

<!-- Outline the; who, what, when, where and how of the study.. -->

OSM data is open, thus it is free to use regardless of the purpose as long as the source is credited. To query OSM database, an `osmextract` package (reference 3) in R has been used. Three metropolitan counties - West Yorkshire, Greater Manchester, and Merseyside - and an administrative area - Greater London - have been chosen as a case study.

To explore OSM data, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was applied. EDA was used to understand the potential and limitations of data. Bar charts have been chosen as a visual tool to show the proportion of a tag to all the highways in a given metropolitan county. The size of data per area can be seen in Table 1. It is important to note, however, that OSM data is constantly being updated, hence the size of data might fluctuate depending on when it was downloaded.

The project has a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/udsleeds/openinfra) with an aim to promote the reproducibility of project outputs. In order to encourage engagement with OSM data, a [website](https://udsleeds.github.io/openinfra/articles/openinfra.html) has been developed which currently contains two articles introducing OSM data.

## Key findings

<!-- Outline the results of the research project. Aim to stick to 2-3 paragraphs. Use imagery (clearly labelled) where appropriate.. -->

The analysis of the chosen areas has shown that footways and cycleways constitute about 1/3 of all the mapped highways in OSM. Greater London stands out as the proportion reaches 1/2 mark. This is not surprising given London's investment in active travel (reference 4). Surprisingly, however, Greater Manchester has very similar network proportion even though it has, in 2018, proposed an ambition to deliver the

## Value of the research

<!-- What is the impact, how will this benefit xyz? How could the research be applied to real-world problems or what is the usage/benefit? -->

It is essential to meet the needs of citizens if active travel is to become a primary modal choice. OpenInfra project explores 

Value of research:
- focus on accessibility
- explore the limitations and benefits of OSM in transport research, specifically accessible infrastructure planning
- improve the the accessibility of OSM data -> vignettes, functions, etc

## Insights


- OSM has a great potential to become a go-to (open) dataset in the accessible infrastructure planning.
- Currently OSM does not live up to its potential because of the missing information on the specifics of a highway that are essential for accessible infrastructure planning.
