One of the key domains in which OpenSteetMap (OSM) data has been utilized is transport research (Arsanjani et al 2015). OSM has been used in agent-based transport simulation (Ziemke et al 2019) and routing (Schmitz et al 2008; Luxen and Vetter 2011), including cycling (Yeboah and Alvanides 2015), walking (Zielstra and Hochmair 2015), wheeling (Neis 2014), and blind pedestrian routing (Cohen and Dalyot 2020). Nevertheless, the quality of OSM data has been a subject of examination (Arsanjani et al 2015), primarily resulting from the perceived unreliability of open crowdsourced data (Basiri et al 2019).

The importance of crowdsourced, including OSM, data has become even more important in data-informed policy decision making. For example, DiGioia et al. (2017) argue that the lack of data complicates the assessment of interventions on cycling safety. Yet, safety is crucial in promoting active modes of travel (cycling, walking, and wheeling) in order to reach UK's Net Zero goals (reference). Indeed, infrastructure is key in ensuring safety (ref) and OSM has a potential to be a primary source of infrastructure data (Nelson et al 2021). 

Even though OSM data is flexible enough to represent active travel infrastructure, its potential in this context is yet be more researched (see Nelson et al 2021). For example, Ferster et al (2019) have examined and compared OSM cycling infrastructure in Canada, but did not, for instance, consider the infrastructure from the perspective of accessibility. There seems to be no equivalent study using OSM data in the context of pedestrian infrastructure planning. 

OpenInfra project, run at the University of Leeds (UK), aims to address the gap of literature on the potential of OSM in transport research with a focus on active travel infrastructure planning. While the primary context is UK, it is expected that the developed methods and tools will be applicable to other contexts.
