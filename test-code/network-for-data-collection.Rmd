```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
# set-up parameters
local_authority_name = "Leeds"
```


# Create a buffer with high cycling potential

```{r}
rnet_pct = pct::get_pct_rnet("west-yorkshire")
rnet_top = rnet_pct |> 
  top_frac(n = 0.1, wt = govtarget_slc)
plot(rnet_pct$geometry, col = "grey")
plot(rnet_top$geometry, add = TRUE)
```


```{r}
routes_fast = pct::get_pct_routes_fast("west-yorkshire")
routes_fast = pct::get_pct_routes_quiet("west-yorkshire")
```

around parts of the route network with high levels of cycling under the Government Target scenario in the PCT
That will look something like this:
Pull out key bits of cycle infrastructure (of all types) from OSM within the buffer
Get fast and quiet routes that pass through the bits of network of interest from the previous stage
