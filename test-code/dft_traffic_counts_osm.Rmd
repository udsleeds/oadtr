The goal of this notebook is no explore the usefulness of motor traffic count data in deciding which highways can be categorized as pedestrian friendly in OSM.
NOTE: move to West Yorkshire example

# in general, boxplots seem to reflect a general understanding of motor traffic distribution. Surprisingly, perhaps, trunk roads have positive skewness and higher dispersion than primary roads. Residential roads have the most outliers, which makes one wonder why -- perhaps it's an indication of rat running? Indeed, the dataset is also small, hence more prone to show skewed results.

# boxplots show median, not mean, hence it might be useful to look at the mean and standard deviations to get a better understanding of distribution of the data.

# relatively large SDs confirms that the data is dispersed. Indeed, for some highways SD is larger than the mean, which leads to negative traffic. It does implies a non-normal distrubution

# Let plot the histogram of motor traffic in residential roads
leeds_traffic_osm_subset_clean %>% sf::st_drop_geometry() %>% filter(highway == "residential") %>% pull(all_motor_vehicles) %>% hist()
# it's strongly positively skewed;
# indeed, this might have resulted from a small sample, yet large dispersion of data makes it hard to assume that certain roads have low motor traffic, hence can be categorized by default as "pedestrian friendly".

next steps:
- write a function that returns a pedestrian network that has sidewalks or motor traffic on major and minor roads is < 1000
  - residential roads always pedestrian friendly?
