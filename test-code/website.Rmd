# Get website working

Currently we have a basic website at https://udsleeds.github.io/openinfra/

Aim: make it better, add placeholder articles, make it autobuild.

Starting point: get website built locally.

```{r}
pkgdown::build_site()
pkgdown::preview_site()
```

The previous version of the homepage can be found at:

```{r}
file.edit("test-code/README-website.Rmd")
```

Set-up webite on GitHub actions...

```{r}
?usethis::use_github_action_check_standard
?pkgdown::build_site_github_pages
usethis::use_github_action_check_standard()
```

When we have the standard actions working we'll set-up pkgdown with:

```{r}
use_github_action("pkgdown")
```
