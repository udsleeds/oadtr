# Get website working

Currently we have a basic website at https://udsleeds.github.io/openinfra/

Aim: make it better, add placeholder articles, make it autobuild.

Starting point: get website built locally.

```{r}
pkgdown::build_site()
pkgdown::preview_site()
```

The previous version of the homepage can be found at:

```{r}
file.edit("test-code/README-website.Rmd")
```
