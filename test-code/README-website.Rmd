Motor traffic-centric perspectives dominate road infrastructure planning [@Parkin2018]. Yet, other (active) travel modes, such as cycling and walking, have been found to bring an array of benefits: improved mental and physical health, decarbonisation, as well as being more efficient in terms of space (i.e., requires less space) [@Parkin2018]. Indeed, in the post-pandemic world, active travel will likely become even more important due to reduced public transport capacities, as highlighted by the Department for Transport's £250m Active Travel Fund (ATF) and £2b allocated to walking and cycling over the next 5 years in the UK alone. Thus, new policies and investment programs, such as the ATF, have led to increased demand for local evidence to inform interventions ranging from new cycleways to improved pavement quality.

Therefore, acknowledging the increasing demand for local evidence to inform decision-making, the project will utilise two datasets - OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Ordnance Survey Open Roads (OSOR) – to explore how open datasets can be used to understand, prioritise, and design active travel infrastructure. The overall aim of the project is to understand the use of OSM data for transport planning, which has the potential to lead to more inclusive and accessible evidence-based decision-making due to its crowdsourced nature.

Methodologically, the project builds on geographic data science^[Importantly, even though active travel research is multi-disciplinary, it has received little attention from data science, with Orozco et al.'s (2020) paper on modelling cycle network growth providing a notable exception.] and previous studies assessing open datasets for transport applications [@Ferster_etal2020; @Haklay2010] and the experiences of lead supervisor (e.g., developing *osmextract* package in R) and PhD student Caroline Tait (who developed a *CycleInfraLnd* package in R) to develop a new package in R for downloading, processing, and adding value to transport datasets. To maximise the policy relevance and impact, the outputs of the project will be disseminated nationwide with the support of external partners (Department for Transport, The Open Innovation Team)^[If you wish to learn more about the project, visit [project's repository](https://github.com/udsleeds/openinfra) on GitHub: <https://github.com/udsleeds/openinfra>].
