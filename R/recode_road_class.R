#' Re-classifies OSM Roads
#' 
#' Determines road classification defined by [Chan and Cooper's](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-55669-8) work. 
#' Specifically re-classifies roads as one of 8 road classes (0-7) specified in the following [table](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-55669-8/tables/6),
#' depending on each features `highway=` key values.
#' 
#' Re-classifies data based on the following highway key values:
#' 
#' Road Class | Description | Selection from OSM
#' -- | -- | --
#' 7 | Motorways | highway = motorway OR highway = motorway_link
#' 6 | Non-residential Dual Carriageways | highway =  trunk OR highway = trunk_link*manual classification needed
#' 5 | Residential Dual Carriageways | highway =  trunk OR highway =  trunk_link*manual classification needed
#' 4 | Primary Roads | highway =  primary OR highway =  primary_link OR (highway =  trunk AND oneway = F)
#' 3 | Secondary Roads | highway =  secondary OR highway =  secondary_link
#' 2 | Tertiary Roads | highway = tertiary OR highway = tertiary_link
#' 1 | Local Roads | highway = living_street OR highway = residential OR highway = unclassified
#' 0 | Traffic-free Paths | highway = cycleway
#'
#' @param osm_sf An `sf` and `data.frame` object containing OpenStreetMap infrastructure data, obtained from the [`osmextract`](https://github.com/ropensci/osmextract) function.
#' @return  The \code{osm_sf} simple features data frame is returned with additional columns road_class and road_desc based on Chan and Cooper's road classifications.
