  abstract = {A large and growing body of evidence suggests fundamental changes are needed in transport systems, to tackle issues such as air pollution, physical inactivity and climate change. Transport models can play a major role in tackling these issues through the transport planning process, but they have historically been focussed on motorised modes (especially cars) and available only to professional transport planners working within the existing paradigm. Building on the principles of open access software, first developed in the context of geographic information systems, this paper develops and discusses the concept of open access transport models, which we define as models that are both developed using open source software and are available to be used by the public without the need for specialist training or the purchase of software licences. We explore the future potential of open access transport models to support the transition away from fossil fuels in the transport sector. We do this with reference to the literature on the use of tools in the planning process, and by exploring an example that is already in use: the ‘Propensity to Cycle Tool’. We conclude that open access transport models can be a leverage point in the planning process due to their ability to provide robust, transparent and actionable evidence that is available to a range of stakeholders, not just professional transport planners. Open access transport models represent a disruptive technology deserving further research and development, by planners, researchers and citizen scientists, including open source software developers and advocacy groups but, in order to fulfil their potential, they will require both financial and policy support from government bodies.},

  abstract = {Designing for Cycle Traffic compares and evaluates international principles and practices for designing for cycle traffic. It sets design for cycling in the wider context of public realm design, traffic planning, traffic engineering and traffic management. Coverage includes: (1) principles for design to ensure inclusivity; (2) planning processes for cycle route networks; (3) design approaches, including capacity calculations for links and junctions, roundabouts and crossings, and signal control; and (4) modelling and level of service assessment approaches. Each chapter is extensively illustrated, provides a concise overview of the topic, and includes an introductory overview and summary of chapter highlights. Written in an accessible style by an established international authority, Designing for Cycle Traffic is essential reading for students, designers and planners in the fields of traffic and highway engineering, spatial and transport planning, architecture and urban design.},
